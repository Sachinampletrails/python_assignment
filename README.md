## Assignments

### 1. Grade Checker
- Takes a numeric score as input.
- Prints the corresponding grade based on the following criteria:
  - 90 and above: **A**
  - 80 to 89: **B**
  - 70 to 79: **C**
  - 60 to 69: **D**
  - Below 60: **F**
- Utilizes basic `if-else` statements.

### 2. Student Grades Management
- Uses a dictionary to store student names as keys and their grades as values.
- Allows the user to:
  - Add a new student and grade.
  - Update an existing studentâ€™s grade.
  - Print all student grades.
- Implements dictionary operations with conditional logic (`if-else`) for interaction.

### 3. Write to a File
- Creates a text file named `example.txt`.
- Writes multiple lines of text into the file.
- Uses file functions such as `open()` and `write()`.
